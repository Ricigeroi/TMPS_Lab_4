# TMPS_Lab_4

## Overview
TMPS_Lab_4 is a C# project demonstrating the use of various design patterns in the context of a library management system. This project is an excellent resource for understanding how design patterns can be implemented in real-world scenarios.

## Features
- **Iterator Pattern**: Implemented through `IBookIterator` and `LibraryIterator` for traversing through collections.
- **Observer Pattern**: Utilized via `IBookObserver` to monitor changes in book status.
- **Strategy Pattern**: Incorporated with `ISortingStrategy`, `StatusSortStrategy`, and `TitleSortStrategy` for flexible sorting mechanisms.
